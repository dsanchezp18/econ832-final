*In this mini paper, I summarize my findings from applying a feedforward neural network to predict choice between two lotteries in @plonsky_etal18 Choice Prediction Competition 2018 (CPC18). * 

# Overview 

The data comes from the CPC18 [@plonsky_etal17], which consists of experiments involving various decision makers choosing between two lotteries. While the complete dataset contains observations from @erev_etal17 's Choice Prediction Competition 2015 (CPC2015), I focus on the newer data exclusive to CPC18.

- `code`: Julia code used in the training of the deep feedforward neural network and related data preparation & feature engineering.

    - `0_setup.jl`: Sets up the Julia environment and installs the required packages.

    - `1_eda.jl`: Conducts exploratory data analysis on the dataset.

    - `2_data_preparation.jl`: Prepares the data for training the deep feedforward neural networks.

    - `3_feature_selection.jl`: Performs analysis on the data to select features for DFNNs

    - `4_baseline_dfnn.jl`: Trains and evaluates the baseline DFNN with risk features only. 

    - `5_attention_dfnn.jl`: Trains and evaluates the attention-based DFNN with risk and attention features.

- `data/`: Contains the data used in the analysis.

- `figures/`: Contains the figures generated by some of the code scripts. 

- `final_env/`: Contains the Julia environment, included to ensure reproducibility of the results.

- `report/`: Contains all files required to compile the `SANCHEZ_Daniel_final_minipaper.pdf` file.
